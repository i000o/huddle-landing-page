## My process

:alien: Icons - classes?
:alien: I think I'm using nesting too much, without purpose. I'm using it all the time when I think I should be using it in instances where it calls for it.
:alien: Made a new branch for 'nesting' to test if I can improve this code - Comparing it often with the `output.css` to see how it presents as pure CSS to help my understanding of Sass' nesting feature.

## Questions

- Why do Font Awesome icons have spaces in the class names? Do I need to use them in this format or can I change? But it refers to the library of icons so I don't think I can...

## Lessons

1. First time using `transition` property - Love a fade
2. I really want to start learning about branches properly so I can make adjustments without finalising yet.
3. HEAD is the current working branchw we're in - Not necessarily main.
4. Git vs. SVN (Subversion)
5. I learnt how to make a new branch, switch to it, and issue pull requests! I did it from the command line using - `git branch nesting`, then `git checkout nesting` which switched to the branch, then `git add sass` to add my changed Sass folder, then `git commit -m "new branch test"`, then `git push origin nesting`! Although I don't know what `origin` means in this context.
6. Finally learnt how the correct way to use `.wrapper` is - I didn't have a clear understanding of what this word referred to before.
7. First time using Font Awesome icons - I don't know if I like it? Is there a better alternative?
